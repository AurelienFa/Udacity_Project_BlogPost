Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.* within the Jupyter Notebook.

Project Motivation
In thie project I was interested in analysing the different attitudes of european citizens with regards to Space. After decades of relatively few industry changes, this has been strongly changed in the past years through mostly US companies / Startups.

A survey of ca. 1,500 europeans citizens was performed in 2016 from the European Space Agency (ESA, https://www.esa.int/ESA). I concentrated myself in this analysis on one subset of questions, quite general.

File Descriptions
This repo is made of a 3 files: 
- one Jupyter notebook in which all exploratory analysis were made
- one readme file (this one)
- the data for this survey, found under http://open.esa.int/citizens-debate-on-space-for-europe-2016-results-data/

Results
I will soon write a Medium Blog Post under which the main conclusions will then be available.
